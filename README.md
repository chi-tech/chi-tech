# Chi-Tech #

Chi-tech is a large-scale scientific simulation engine being developed at 
Texas A&M University as part of a research study on massively parallel 
algorithms for modeling and simulation. Currently, the main physics modules 
of Chi-Tech deal with solving the linear Boltzmann equation and 
diffusion-reaction physics.
