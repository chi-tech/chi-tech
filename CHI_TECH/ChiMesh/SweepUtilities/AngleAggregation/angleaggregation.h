/**Angle aggregation has to cater for running the 8 corners of a 3D
 * partitioning, the 4 corners of a 2D partitioning (the latter 2 both being
 * polar angle aggregation) as well as single angle aggregation.
 *
 * At the most fundamental level this manifests as a number of angle indices
 * that share a SPDS, however SPDS do not have to be unique which allows
 * the notion of polar angle sets.
 * For single angle aggregation each SPDS is associated
 * with a single angle index. For polar angle aggregation a single SPDS can
 * have multiple indices associated with the same azimuthal angle but
 * different polar angles. We call this manifestation a "AngleSet".
 *
 * The octant based separation is achieved via the notion of "AngleSetGroup"
 * which will group angle sets for each quadrant or octant
 * (depending on 2D or 3D).*/
