We split a `MeshGenerator`'s execution into a
phase that generates an unpartitioned mesh and a phase that then converts
this mesh into partitioned `chi_mesh::MeshContinuum` (with both steps
customizable). The phase that creates the `MeshContinuum` object can be hooked
up to a partitioner that can also be designed to be pluggable.

## Example A
\code
nodes = {-1.0,-0.75,-0.5,-0.25,0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0}
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.OrthogonalMeshGenerator.Create({ node_sets = {nodes,nodes} })
chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)

chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToVTK("ZMeshTest")
\endcode

In this example we created a set of nodes (monotonically increasing in value)
for use with the
\ref chi_mesh__OrthogonalMeshGenerator. We supplied the same set twice meaning the generator
will build a 2D mesh.

We did not specify a partitioner and therefore the generator will use the
\ref chi__PETScGraphPartitioner with `type="parmetis"` by default. Using 8
processes, we can see the mesh and it's partitioning below.

## Example B
\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.FromFileMeshGenerator.Create({ filename="TriangleMesh2x2.obj" })
chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)

chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToVTK("ZMeshTest")
\endcode

In this example we created a mesh by reading it from a file, using the
\ref chi_mesh__FromFileMeshGenerator. The types of file-types we can support is
ever growing. At the time of writing this we support the following formats:
- `.obj` Wavefront
- `.msh` gmesh,
- `.e` ExodusII,
- `.vtu` VTK Unstructured grid,
- `.pvtu` Pieced VTK Unstructured grid,
- `.case` Ensight Gold

Using 8 processes, we can see the mesh and it's partitioning below.

## Example C
\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.ExtruderMeshGenerator.Create
({
  inputs =
  {
    chi_mesh.FromFileMeshGenerator.Create({ filename=TriangleMesh2x2.obj" }),
  },
  layers = {{z=1.1, n=2},    -- First layer - 2 sub-layers
            {z=2.1, n=3}},   -- Second layer - 3 sub-layers
})
chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)

chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToVTK("ZMeshTest")
\endcode

In this example we use an \ref chi_mesh__ExtruderMeshGenerator with another
mesh generator as an input to create an extruded mesh. Using 8 processes, we can
see the mesh and it's partitioning below.

## Using different Partitioners
ChiTech now has a set of Graph Partitioners (i.e. based off `GraphPartitioner`)
that support different forms of partitioning, for example we have:
- \ref chi__LinearGraphPartitioner, a very basic partitioner used for
during the preparation of simulation meshes.
- \ref chi__PETScGraphPartitioner, a flexible partitioner that can use all the
partitioner options available in PETSc (defaults to using `"parmetis"`).
- \ref chi__KBAGraphPartitioner, the classical Neutron Transport KBA parallel
partitioning with an overlaid orthogonal layout.

An example of changing the partitioning to PETSc's `"average"` option is shown
below:
\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.ExtruderMeshGenerator.Create
({
  inputs =
  {
    chi_mesh.FromFileMeshGenerator.Create
    ({
      filename="resources/TestMeshes/TriangleMesh2x2.obj"
    }),
  },
  layers = {{z=1.1, n=2}, {z=2.1, n=3}},
  partitioner = chi.PETScGraphPartitioner.Create({type="average"})
})
chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)

chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToVTK("ZMeshTest")
\endcode

Another example using the `KBAGraphPartitioner` is shown below
\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.ExtruderMeshGenerator.Create
({
  inputs =
  {
    chi_mesh.FromFileMeshGenerator.Create
    ({
      filename="resources/TestMeshes/TriangleMesh2x2.obj"
    }),
  },
  layers = {{z=1.1, n=2}, {z=2.1, n=3}},
  partitioner = chi.KBAGraphPartitioner.Create
  ({
    nx = 2, ny=2, nz=2,
    xcuts = {0.0}, ycuts = {0.0}, zcuts = {1.1}
  })
})
chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)

chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToVTK("ZMeshTest")
\endcode

## The special SplitFileMeshGenerator

For very large meshes the mesh generation process could both take very long and
require a lot of memory. The current mode of operation of the mesh generators is
that each process builds the mesh as an unpartitioned mesh then the mesh gets
converted to a partitioned mesh. Therefore, when a lot of processes are used,
there could be a large memory spike, large enough to be greater than what even
an HPC node has available. To partly address this problem we have the
\ref chi_mesh__SplitFileMeshGenerator. This generator will process multiple mesh inputs like
any other mesh generator but instead of building the mesh on each processor only
the home location builds the mesh. Thereafter the mesh is partitioned and each
processors' local-cells, ghost-cells, and relevant vertices are written to
separate binary files. The default folder, into which these files are written,
is named "SplitMesh" and the default file names for the meshes are
"split_mesh_x.cmesh", where the x represents the processors rank. Both the
folder name and file name prefixes (i.e. the "split_mesh" part) can be altered
via input parameters.

It is also possible to generate split meshes in serial by supplying the
`num_parts` parameter. Also, if a simulation uses the same mesh over and over
then the parameter `read_only` can be used to suppress the mesh being
created every single time.

### SplitFile Example A

\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.SplitFileMeshGenerator.Create
({
  inputs =
  {
    chi_mesh.OrthogonalMeshGenerator.Create({ node_sets = {xmesh,ymesh,zmesh} })
  },
})

chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)
\endcode

The examples below will create, in the current working directory, the folder
`SplitMesh` and within it `split_mesh_0.cmesh`, `split_mesh_1.cmesh`, etc.

### SplitFile Example B

\code
meshgen1 = chi_mesh.SplitFileMeshGenerator.Create
({
  inputs = {
    chi_mesh.OrthogonalMeshGenerator.Create({ node_sets = {xmesh,ymesh} }),
    chi_mesh.ExtruderMeshGenerator.Create
    ({
      layers = {{z=Lz, n=Nz}}
    })
  }
})

chi_mesh.MeshGenerator.Execute(meshgen1)
\endcode

This example is the same as the one above it, however, it uses the extruder
mesh generator in a chain.

\note Partitioning and the other parameters of \ref chi_mesh__SplitFileMeshGenerator are
identical to that of the base \ref chi_mesh__MeshGenerator.
