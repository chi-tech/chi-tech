## Steady state simulations:

The cross sections can be used in simulations solving the steady state
Linear Boltzmann Equation of the form:

\f[
\vec{\Omega}_n \boldsymbol{\cdot} \vec{\nabla} \psi_{ng} +
\sigma_{tg} \psi_{ng} =
\sum_{\ell=0}^L \sum_{m=-\ell}^{+\ell} \frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}
Y_{\ell m} (\vec{\Omega}_n)
\sum_{g'=0}^{G-1} \sigma_{s\ell,g'{\to}g} \phi_{\ell m,g'} +
q_{ext,ng} + q_{fission,ng}
\f]

The two most prominent items required here includes \f$ \sigma_{tg} \f$ and
\f$ \sigma_{s\ell,g'{\to}g} \f$. The latter is an entry in a structure we
call a generic transfer matrix for moment \f$ \ell \f$ with rows \f$g=0..G-1\f$
and columns \f$g'=0..G-1\f$. These two items are often the only items required
in a transport simulation.

In simulations with fission-sources, cross sections support two formats,
the simple combined cross sections without delayed neutrons

\f[
q_{fission,ng} = \frac{\chi_g}{4\pi}
\sum_{g'=0}^{G-1} \nu_{g'} \sigma_{fg'} \phi_{00g'}
\f]

and those with delayed neutrons, the latter which are currently only used in
the k-eigenvalue solver.

## k-eigenvalue related items
As stated before, the cross section file supports two formats, the simple
combined cross sections without delayed neutrons which are depicted above
and those with delayed neutrons shown below

\f[
q_{fission,ng} = \frac{\chi_g}{4\pi}
\sum_{g'=0}^{G-1} \nu_{prompt,g'} \sigma_{fg'} \phi_{00g'}
+ \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \frac{\chi_{delayed,jg}}{4\pi} \gamma_j
  \sum_{g'=0}^{G-1} \nu_{delayed,g'} \sigma_{fg'} \phi_{00g'}
  \f].

Codes may also choose to update precursor concentrations for which their decay
constants, \f$ \lambda_j \f$ are required.

## Keyword definitions

- NUM_GROUPS num_groups Required. Specifies the number of groups for this
  cross section. Symbol \f$ G \f$.
- NUM_MOMENTS num_moments Required. The number of transfer matrices to allocate
  for this cross section (whether used or not). Typically this number is one
  greater than the scattering order (i.e., \f$ L+1 \f$)
- NUM_PRECURSORS num_precursors Optional. Indicates how many precursors are used
  in this cross section. Symbol \f$ J \f$
- Optional key words per line:
    - SIGMA_T_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      SIGMA_T_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, sigma_t]. Populates the sigma_tg field. Symbol \f$ \sigma_{tg} \f$.
    - SIGMA_A_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      SIGMA_A_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, sigma_a]. Populates the sigma_ag field. Symbol \f$ \sigma_{ag} \f$.
      If this is not supplied then sigma_a is estimated from the transfer matrix
      and may erroneously estimate balance.
    - SIGMA_F_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      SIGMA_F_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, sigma_f]. Populates the sigma_fg field. Symbol \f$ \sigma_{fg} \f$.
    - NU_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line NU_END.
      Each line in the block processes the first two words as [group, nu].
      Populates the nu field. Upon completing the file processing the nu_sigma_fg
      field gets populated from the product of nu and sigma_fg.
      Symbol \f$ \nu_g \f$.
    - NU_PROMPT_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      NU_PROMPT_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, nu_prompt]. Populates the nu_prompt field. Upon completing the file
      processing the nu_p_sigma_fg field gets populated from the product of
      nu_prompt and sigma_fg. Symbol \f$ \nu_{prompt,g} \f$.
    - NU_DELAYED_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      NU_DELAYED_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, nu_delayed]. Populates the nu_delayed field. Upon completing the
      file processing the nu_d_sigma_fg field gets populated from the product of
      nu_delayed and sigma_fg. Symbol \f$ \nu_{delayed,g} \f$.
    - CHI_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      CHI_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, chi]. Populates the chi field. Symbol \f$ \chi_{g} \f$.
    - CHI_PROMPT_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      CHI_PROMPT_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, chi]. Populates the chi_prompt field.
      Symbol \f$ \chi_{prompt, g} \f$.
    - VELOCITY_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      VELOCITY_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, velocity]. Populates the inv_velocity field by inverting parsed
      values. Symbol \f$ \frac{1}{v_g} \f$.
    - INV_VELOCITY_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      INV_VELOCITY_END. Each line in the block processes the first two words as
      [group, inv_velocity]. Populates the inv_velocity field. If this field and
      VELOCITY are provided, this field will be used.
      Symbol \f$ \frac{1}{v_g} \f$.
    - PRECURSOR_DECAY_CONSTANTS_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a
      line PRECURSOR_DECAY_CONSTANTS_END. Each line in the block processes the first two
      words as [precursor, lambda]. Populates the lambda field (the precursor
      decay constant). Symbol \f$ \lambda_j \f$.
    - PRECURSOR_FRACTIONAL_YIELDS_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a
      line PRECURSOR_FRACTIONAL_YIELDS_END. Each line in the block processes the first two
      words as [precursor, gamma]. Populates the gamma field (the precursor
      production fraction per fission). Symbol \f$ \gamma_j \f$.
    - CHI_DELAYED_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a line
      CHI_DELAYED_END. Each line in the block processes the first word as the
      group index and the remaining NUM_PRECURSORS words as the the individual
      precursor's associated delayed spectrum (chi). Populates the chi_d field.
      Symbol \f$ \chi_{delayed,jg} \f$.
    - TRANSFER_MOMENTS_BEGIN. Optional. Starts a block that is terminated by a
      line TRANSFER_MOMENTS_END. Each line in the block processes a line only if
      it starts with the keyword M_GPRIME_G_VAL which needs to be followed by four
      values [moment,gprime,g,value]. Populates transfer-matrix for moment m,
      row g, column gprime, with value. Symbol \f$ \sigma_{s\ell,g'{\to}g} \f$.

- Comments can be between individual blocks but only the TRANSFER_MOMENTS block
  may have comments between the _BEGIN and _END
- Comments do not have to start with any specific character since the file
  format is keyword driven.
- Any number that is not convertible to its required type (integer, double)
  will throw an error to that effect.
- All errors will indicate the current file, line number and nature of the error.
