# User Tutorials

## Lua for users

Chi-Tech input files are written in Lua: 
- Some of the code objects are directly accessible in the Lua console,
- Portion of the input can often be generated using Lua scripting.

Hence, we recommend the users to familiarize themselves with Lua. 
See the [official lua page](https://www.lua.org/) for more details.

1. A table of all existing lua functions accessible from the lua input file 
can be found on the main page of the documentation 
[https://chi-tech.github.io/index.html](https://chi-tech.github.io/index.html), 
under the **Input Functions** label;
2. If you prefer a hierarchical list of those lua functions, there are also found from the main page of the 
documentation, by clicking on the left column on [
Input Reference](https://chi-tech.github.io/modules.html).

If you build the documentation locally, the above instructions should 
help you locate the local versions of those pages.

## Meshing

Chi-Tech handles many types of meshes, including arbitrary polyhedral meshes. 
Complex meshes are often generated externally and loaded into Chi-Tech. 
Hence, it is important for users to be familiar with CAD and mesh generators.

We provide some [meshing tutorial here](https://chi-tech.github.io/d4/d25/_mesh_tutorials.html) 
but recommend users seek additional knowledge when needed.

## Example of lua input files
A set of lua example files can be found:
1. in the documentation: In the left column on the main documentation page, click
on [Tutorials](https://chi-tech.github.io/d8/d2d/_tutorial00.html); 
these are fully commented out input files. 
2. in the ```tests``` folder: these files are the regression suite input files but 
they cover quite a few situations.
