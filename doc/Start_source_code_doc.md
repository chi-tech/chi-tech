# Documentation

1. The preferred method of accessing the documentation is to clone the repo and
build the doxygen-based documentation. See the [Compilation and run instructions](./Start_install.md)
2. However, the documentation is also periodically updated online at [https://chi-tech.github.io](https://chi-tech.github.io)

To generate only input documentation and pages, execute
```
./YReGenerateDocumentation.sh input_doc_only
```
 This can be a lot faster than generating the documentation for ALL of the
 source code.
