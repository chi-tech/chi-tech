\section CodeTut93Sec1 1 Introduction
Monte Carlo based flux estimators traditionally use a number of tracks, traced
within a volume, to estimate the scalar flux. For \f$ N_t \f$ amount of tracks
traced inside a volume, \f$ V \f$, originating from a sample of \f$ N_p \f$
number of particles/rays, the scalar flux, \f$ \phi \f$, can be estimated with
\f[
\phi \approx \frac{1}{N_p V} \sum_t^{N_t} \ell_t,
\f]
where \f$ \ell_t \f$ is the \f$ t \f$-th track length. This simply means that
the scalar flux is the "average track length per unit volume".

The individual tracks of these particles can be assigned a weight, \f$ w_t \f$,
enabling a multitude of features.
\f[
\phi \approx \frac{1}{N_p V} \sum_t^{N_t} \ell_t w_t,
\f]
For our purposes we are interested in three possible
weightings, i) weighting by a spherical harmonic, which can be used to compute
flux moments, ii) weighting by average FE
shape function values, allowing the projection of flux onto a FE space, and
finally iii) weighting with an exponential attenuation, allowing the computation
of uncollided flux.

\subsection CodeTut93Sec1_1 1.1 Weighting with a spherical harmonic
Applying a weight with a spherical harmonic is conceptually simple. For the
\f$ t \f$-th track we simply set the weight to the spherical harmonic evaluated
with the direction, \f$ \boldsymbol{\Omega}_t \f$, of the track,
\f[
\phi_{\ell m} \approx \frac{1}{N_p V} \sum_t^{N_t} \ell_t Y_{\ell m}(
\boldsymbol{\Omega}_t),
\f]

\subsection CodeTut93Sec1_2 1.2 Weighting by average FE shape function values
For a DFEM projection of the fluxes we require nodal values, on each cell, for
a given flux quantity, \f$ \phi \f$. Therefore we seek \f$ \phi_h \f$ such that
\f{eqnarray*}{
\int_V b_i \phi_h dV = \int_V b_i \phi dV
\f}
and since \f$ \phi_h = \sum_j b_j \phi_j \f$ we need to solve the cell-by-cell
system defined by
\f{eqnarray*}{
\sum_j \phi_j \int_V b_i b_j dV = \int_V b_i \phi dV.
\f}
In this system the entries \f$ \int_V b_i b_j dV \f$ are simply the entries of
the mass matrix, \f$ M_{ij} = \int_V b_i b_j dV \f$, and we still need to find
the rhs-entries \f$ \int_V b_i \phi dV \f$. This is where we will use the track
length based estimators by weighting with the shape functions b_i.


In this formulation we have
\f{eqnarray*}{
\int_V b_i \phi dV \approx \frac{1}{N_p} \sum_t \ell_t w_t^{i,avg}
\f}
where
\f[
w_t^{i,avg} = \frac{ \int_{s_a}^{s_b} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds }
 {\int_{s_a}^{s_b} ds} =
\frac{ \int_{s_a}^{s_b} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds }
 {\ell_t},
\f]
the average basis function value along the track. For ordinary Lagrange FE shape
functions, which are not defined piecewise, the integral in the numerator can be
obtained exactly using a numerical quadrature. For our applications, where we
use the PWLD FE shape functions we need to split this integral per segment of
the basic cell crossed.

For example, consider the polygon below, where a ray is traced from position
\f$ s_a \f$ to \f$ s_b \f$.
\image html CodingTutorials/Tut93_segments.png width=350px

The track traced across the cell needs to be split into the segments defined by the
sub-triangles of the polygon it crossed (for polyhedrons this would be the
sub-tetrahedrons). Therefore the track \f$ s_a \to s_b \f$
needs to be split into tracks \f$ s_0 \to s_1 \f$, \f$ s_1 \to s_2 \f$ and
\f$ s_2 \to s_3 \f$ as per the figure. Therefore the integral becomes

\f[
\int_{s_a}^{s_b} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds =
\int_{s_0}^{s_1} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds +
\int_{s_1}^{s_2} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds +
\int_{s_2}^{s_3} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds
\f]
which we can evaluate analytically since it is linear on each
segment.

<b>Note:</b> The mapping of \f$ s\mapsto \mathbf{x} \f$ can be quite expensive so
in this particular case it would be better to evaluate the shape function at
the half-way point of each segment, after which the integral becomes
\f[
\int_{s_a}^{s_b} b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds =
b_i(\frac{s_0 + s_1}{2}\mapsto \mathbf{x}) (s_1 - s_0) +
b_i(\frac{s_1 + s_2}{2}\mapsto \mathbf{x}) (s_2 - s_1) +
b_i(\frac{s_2 + s_3}{2}\mapsto \mathbf{x}) (s_3 - s_2) +
\f]

\subsection CodeTut93Sec1_3 1.3 Weighting with an exponential attenuation
Weighting with an exponential attenuation adds the final piece of weighting
necessary to efficiently compute the uncollided flux.

The exponential attenuation of the uncollided flux, \f$ \psi \f$, along the path
of a ray with direction \f$ \boldsymbol{\Omega} \f$ is expressed as
\f[
\frac{d\psi}{ds} = -\sigma_t(s) \psi(s)
\f]
where \f$ s \f$ is the distance traveled and \f$ \sigma_t \f$ is the total
cross section. From this model we can compute the attenuation across a cell,
with constant \f$ \sigma_t \f$, as
\f[
\psi(s) = \psi(s=0) e^{-\sigma_t s}
\f]
where \f$ \psi(s=0) \f$ is the value of \f$ \psi \f$ when it entered the cell.


To assimilate all of this into a raytracing algorithm we start a source particle
with a weight, \f$ w^p = 1 \f$, which acts as the proxy for \f$ \psi \f$
(i.e., \f$ w^p \equiv \psi \f$). From
this we can determine the nodal uncollided flux, \f$ \phi^{uc} \f$, in a similar
fashion as we would determine the regular flux, i.e.,
\f[
\sum_j \phi_j^{uc} \int_V b_i b_j dV = \int_V b_i \phi^{uc} dV,
\f]
however, now we need additional treatment for the integral containing
\f$ \phi^{uc} \f$, for which we have
\f[
\int_V b_i \phi^{uc} dV \approx \frac{1}{N_p} \sum_t \ell_t w_t^{i,avg},
\f]
where, this time,
\f[
w_t^{i,avg} =
\frac{ \int_{s_a}^{s_b} w^p(s) b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds }
 {\ell_t}.
\f]
Note here that \f$ w^p \f$ is a function of position, specifically
\f[
w^p(s) = w^p(s=s_a) e^{-\sigma_t s}
\f]
and so is the basis function \f$ b_i \f$.

The form of this integral needs to split into segments in the same way we
did in the previous subsection. Therefore, given K amount of segments, we now have
\f[
\ell_t w_t^{i,avg} = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \ell_{tk} w_{tk}^{i,avg}
\f]
where \f$ \ell_{tk} \f$ is the track length of the \f$ k \f$-th segment and
\f$ w_{tk}^{i,avg} \f$ is the average weight of this segment. The weight is
computed with
\f[
w_{tk}^{i,avg} =
\frac{ \int_{s_k}^{s_{k+1}} w^p(s) b_i(s\mapsto \mathbf{x}) ds }
 {\ell_{tk}}.
\f]
where \f$ s_k \f$ and \f$ s_{k+1} \f$ are the beginning and ending positions of
segment \f$ k \f$ respectively.

Note here that, since we have an expression for \f$ w^p \f$, we can compute
\f$ w^p \f$ at any point along track \f$ t \f$ including at the start of any
segment. Therefore we define
\f$
w_k^p = w^p(s=s_k)
\f$
which allows us to express \f$ w^p \f$ as
\f[
w^p(s) = w_k^p e^{-\sigma_t(s-s_k)}, \quad \quad \quad s\in[s_k,s_{k+1}]
\f]


Additionally we express the basis functions on a segment, since we
know the shape function is linear on the segment, as
\f[
b_i(s) =
b_{i,k} \frac{s_{k+1}-s}{s_{k+1}-s_k} +
b_{i,k+1} \frac{s-s_k}{s_{k+1}-s_k}
\f]
where \f$ b_{i,k} \f$ and \f$ b_{i,k+1} \f$ are the basis function values at the
beginning and end of the segment, respectively. These two expressions allow us to
evaluate the segment average weight as
\f[
w_{tk}^{i,avg} =
\frac{1}{\ell_{tk}}
\int_{s_k}^{s_{k+1}}  w_k^p e^{-\sigma_t(s-s_k)}
\biggr[
b_{i,k} \frac{s_{k+1}-s}{s_{k+1}-s_k} +
b_{i,k+1} \frac{s-s_k}{s_{k+1}-s_k}
\biggr] ds
\f]
and since \f$ s_{k+1}-s_k = \ell_{tk} \f$ we can simplify this expression as

\f{align*}{
w_{tk}^{i,avg} &=
\frac{1}{\ell_{tk}}
\int_{0}^{\ell_{tk}}  w_k^p e^{-\sigma_t s' }
\biggr[
b_{i,k} \frac{\ell_{tk}-s'}{\ell_{tk}} +
b_{i,k+1} \frac{s'}{\ell_{tk}}
\biggr] ds'
\\
&= \frac{1}{\ell_{tk}^2}
\int_{0}^{\ell_{tk}}  w_k^p e^{-\sigma_t s' }
\biggr[
b_{i,k} \ell_{tk} +
(b_{i,k+1} - b_{i,k} ) s'
\biggr] ds'
\f}
which is in the general form
\f[
w_{tk}^{i,avg} =
\frac{w_k^p}{\ell_{tk}^2}
\int_{0}^{\ell_{tk}}  e^{-\sigma_t s'}
\biggr[
C_0 + C_1 s'
\biggr] ds'
\f]
where
\f[
C_0 = b_{i,k} \ell_{tk}
\f]
\f[
C_1 = b_{i,k+1} - b_{i,k}.
\f]

With these constants defined the expression can be evaluated analytically

\f[
w_{tk}^{i,avg} =
\frac{w_k^p}{\ell_{tk}^2}
\biggr[
\frac{C_0}{\sigma_t} (1-e^{-\sigma_t \ell_{tk}})
+
\frac{C_1}{\sigma_t^2}
\biggr(
 1 - (1 + \sigma_t \ell_{tk} )
\biggr)e^{-\sigma_t \ell_{tk}}
\biggr]
\f]


\section CodeTut93Sec2 2 Program setup
We start by getting the grid as usual:
\code
auto grid_ptr = chi_mesh::GetCurrentHandler().GetGrid();
const auto& grid = *grid_ptr;

chi::log.Log() << "Global num cells: " << grid.GetGlobalNumberOfCells();

const int dimension = (grid.Attributes() & chi_mesh::DIMENSION_1)? 1 :
                      (grid.Attributes() & chi_mesh::DIMENSION_2)? 2 :
                      (grid.Attributes() & chi_mesh::DIMENSION_3)? 3 : 0;
\endcode
Note here that we grab the `dimension`.


Next we set a number of parameters important to the simulation:
\code
const size_t num_groups = 1;
const size_t scattering_order = 1;
const auto& L = scattering_order;
const size_t num_moments =
  (dimension == 1)? L + 1 :
  (dimension == 2)? (L+1)*(L+2)/2 :
  (dimension == 3)? (L+1)*(L+1) : 0;
const double sigma_t = 0.27;

// Build harmonic map
std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> m_to_ell_em_map;
if (dimension == 1)
  for (int ell=0; ell<=scattering_order; ell++)
    m_to_ell_em_map.emplace_back(ell,0);
else if (dimension == 2)
  for (int ell=0; ell<=scattering_order; ell++)
    for (int m=-ell; m<=ell; m+=2)
      m_to_ell_em_map.emplace_back(ell,m);
else if (dimension == 3)
  for (int ell=0; ell<=scattering_order; ell++)
    for (int m=-ell; m<=ell; m++)
      m_to_ell_em_map.emplace_back(ell,m);
\endcode
The interesting items here includes the `scattering_order` and the map from
linear moment index to harmonic indices, `m_to_ell_em_map`. See the
<a href="https://github.com/doctor-janv/whitepapers/blob/main/ChiTech-LBS-TheoryManual/ChiTech-LBS-TheoryManual_v_1_13.pdf">LBS Whitepaper</a>
for the detail of this but in a nutshell... Only some of the harmonics are relevant
in certain dimensions.


Next we build the spatial discretization, which in this case would be a PWLD
discretization, and we do this as normal:
\code
typedef std::shared_ptr<chi_math::SpatialDiscretization> SDMPtr;
SDMPtr sdm_ptr = chi_math::SpatialDiscretization_PWLD::New(grid_ptr);
const auto& sdm = *sdm_ptr;
\endcode

For the unknown manager and DOF-counts we build an unknown manager as follows:
\code
chi_math::UnknownManager phi_uk_man;
for (size_t m=0; m<num_moments; ++m)
  phi_uk_man.AddUnknown(chi_math::UnknownType::VECTOR_N, num_groups);
\endcode

And then grab the dof-counts
\code
const size_t num_fem_local_dofs = sdm.GetNumLocalDOFs(phi_uk_man);
const size_t num_fem_globl_dofs = sdm.GetNumGlobalDOFs(phi_uk_man);

chi::log.Log() << "Num local FEM DOFs: " << num_fem_local_dofs;
chi::log.Log() << "Num globl FEM DOFs: " << num_fem_globl_dofs;
\endcode

This allows us to define the business end, which is the flux tally vector:
\code
std::vector<double> phi_tally(num_fem_local_dofs, 0.0);
\endcode

\section CodeTut93Sec3 3 The particle/ray data structure
The particle/ray data structure is the packet of data that we will be sending
around in our ray tracing algorithm. First we need the basic structure:
\code
typedef chi_mesh::Vector3 Vec3;
struct Particle
{
  Vec3 position = {0.0,0.0,0.0};
  Vec3 direction = {0.0,0.0,0.0};
  int  energy_group = 0;
  double weight = 1.0;

  uint64_t cell_id = 0;

  bool alive = true;
};
\endcode
This is all basic stuff. Essentially the particle's state is tracked with the
members `position`, `direction`, `energy_group` and `weight`. The other two
members are simply auxiliary items to assist with the transport process.

Next we define a source, along with the determining which cell contains the
source:
\code
const Vec3 source_pos = {0.0,0.0,0.0};

chi_mesh::Cell const* source_cell_ptr = nullptr;

for (auto& cell : grid.local_cells)
  if (grid.CheckPointInsideCell(cell, source_pos))
  {
    source_cell_ptr = &cell;
    break;
  }
if (source_cell_ptr == nullptr)
  throw std::logic_error(fname + ": Source cell not found.");

const uint64_t source_cell_id = source_cell_ptr->global_id;
\endcode
Notice here we used the grid utility `CheckPointInsideCell`.

\section CodeTut93Sec4 4 Utility lambdas
In this section we define 3 utility functions in the form of c++ lambdas.
i) A routine to sample a random direction. This gets used when we sample the
source.
ii) A routine to contribute a track to a PWLD tally. This is very complicated
and will be explained.
iii) A routine to approximate a given cell's size. The approximate cell sizes
are used by the raytracer (which we will discuss later) to set appropriate
tolerances used during the sub-routines of the raytracer.

\subsection CodeTut93Sec4_1 4.1 Sampling a random direction
Given a random number generator we can use two random numbers to sample the
azimuthal- and polar directions. The azimuthal angle is sampled uniformly, i.e.,
\f$ \varphi \in [0,2\pi] \f$ whilst the polar angle is determined by sampling
the cosine of the polar angle uniformly, i.e.,
\f$ \cos \theta = \mu \in [-1,1] \f$.

\code
chi_math::RandomNumberGenerator rng;
auto SampleRandomDirection = [&rng]()
{
  double costheta = 2.0*rng.Rand() - 1.0;
  double theta    = acos(costheta);
  double varphi   = rng.Rand()*2.0*M_PI;

  return chi_mesh::Vector3{sin(theta) * cos(varphi),
                           sin(theta) * sin(varphi),
                           cos(theta)};
};
\endcode
It is important to note that one should only use a single random number, which,
gets reused, and not define new ones since the random seed for new generators
will be the same.

\subsection CodeTut93Sec4_2 4.2 PWLD Tally contribution
The tally contribution routine takes a track, defined by a starting and ending
position, and contributes it to the specified cell's tally information. Of course
additional information about the particle creating the track is also provided,
i.e., the direction, energy group index and weight at the starting position.

\code
auto ContributePWLDTally = [&sdm,&grid,&phi_tally,&phi_uk_man,&sigma_t,
                              &num_moments,&m_to_ell_em_map](
  const chi_mesh::Cell& cell,
  const Vec3& positionA,
  const Vec3& positionB,
  const Vec3& omega,
  const int g,
  double weight)
{
  const auto& cell_mapping = sdm.GetCellMapping(cell);
  const size_t num_nodes = cell_mapping.NumNodes();

  const auto phi_theta = chi_math::OmegaToPhiThetaSafe(omega);
  const double phi = phi_theta.first;
  const double theta = phi_theta.second;

  std::vector<double> segment_lengths;
  chi_mesh::PopulateRaySegmentLengths(grid,             //input
                                      cell,             //input
                                      positionA,        //input
                                      positionB,        //input
                                      omega,            //input
                                      segment_lengths); //output

  std::vector<double> shape_values_k;   //At s_k
  std::vector<double> shape_values_kp1; //At s_{k+1}

  cell_mapping.ShapeValues(positionA,       //input
                           shape_values_k); //output

  double d_run_sum = 0.0;
  for (const auto& segment_length_k : segment_lengths)
  {
    d_run_sum += segment_length_k;
    const double& d = d_run_sum;

    cell_mapping.ShapeValues(positionA+omega*d, shape_values_kp1);

    const auto&   b_ik   = shape_values_k;
    const auto&   b_ikp1 = shape_values_kp1;
    const double& ell_k  = segment_length_k;

    for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
    {
      const double C0 = b_ik[i] * ell_k;
      const double C1 = b_ikp1[i] - b_ik[i];

      for (size_t m=0; m < num_moments; ++m)
      {
        const int64_t dof_map = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);

        //================= Apply harmonic weight
        const auto& ell_em = m_to_ell_em_map.at(m);
        const int ell = ell_em.first;
        const int em = ell_em.second;

        double w_harmonic = chi_math::Ylm(ell, em, phi, theta);

        //================= Apply exponential attenuation weight
        double w_exp  = (C0 / sigma_t) * (1.0 - exp(-sigma_t * ell_k)) +
                        (C1 / (sigma_t * sigma_t)) *
                        (1.0 - (1 + sigma_t * ell_k) * exp(-sigma_t * ell_k));
               w_exp *= weight / (ell_k * ell_k);

        //================= Combine
        double w_avg = w_harmonic * w_exp;

        phi_tally[dof_map] += ell_k * w_avg ;
      }//for moment m
    }//for node i

    shape_values_k = shape_values_kp1;
    weight *= exp(-sigma_t * segment_length_k);
  }//for d
};
\endcode

The first portion of this routine is just housekeeping,
\code
const auto& cell_mapping = sdm.GetCellMapping(cell);
const size_t num_nodes = cell_mapping.NumNodes();

const auto phi_theta = chi_math::OmegaToPhiThetaSafe(omega);
const double phi = phi_theta.first;
const double theta = phi_theta.second;
\endcode
We get the cell mapping, number of nodes, and we convert the direction vector
to a \f$ (\varphi, \theta) \f$ pair. The latter will be used for the harmonic
weighting.

Next we determing the segments crossed by this track. This information is
populated into a vector of segment lengths, sorted according to the direction
traveled by the ray, by using the routine
`chi_mesh::PopulateRaySegmentLengths()`.
\code
std::vector<double> segment_lengths;
chi_mesh::PopulateRaySegmentLengths(grid,             //input
                                    cell,             //input
                                    positionA,        //input
                                    positionB,        //input
                                    omega,            //input
                                    segment_lengths); //output
\endcode

We then declare two vectors that will hold the shape function values at
different places on the segments. We can immediately determine the shape values
at \f$ s_0 \f$ since this will be at position A.
\code
std::vector<double> shape_values_k;   //At s_k
std::vector<double> shape_values_kp1; //At s_{k+1}

cell_mapping.ShapeValues(positionA,       //input
                         shape_values_k); //output
\endcode


Next we start looping over the segments.
\code
double d_run_sum = 0.0;
for (const auto& segment_length_k : segment_lengths)
{
  d_run_sum += segment_length_k;
  const double& d = d_run_sum;

  cell_mapping.ShapeValues(positionA+omega*d, shape_values_kp1);

  const auto&   b_ik   = shape_values_k;
  const auto&   b_ikp1 = shape_values_kp1;
  const double& ell_k  = segment_length_k;
\endcode
We determine the end position of the segment using a running sum of the total
segments traversed. We then populate the shape function values at \f$ s_{k+1} \f$
and rename both sets of shape function values and the segment length for
convenience.

Next we loop over the nodes and moments.
\code
for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
{
  const double C0 = b_ik[i] * ell_k;
  const double C1 = b_ikp1[i] - b_ik[i];

  for (size_t m=0; m < num_moments; ++m)
  {
    const int64_t dof_map = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);
\endcode
Once a node is identified we compute the constants C0 and C1. Also once in the
moment loop we can obtain the DOF local index of the tally.


Next we compute the harmonic weighting:
\code
const auto& ell_em = m_to_ell_em_map.at(m);
const int ell = ell_em.first;
const int em = ell_em.second;

double w_harmonic = chi_math::Ylm(ell, em, phi, theta);
\endcode


Then we compute the exponential weighting based on the formula
\f[
w_{tk}^{i,avg} =
\frac{w_k^p}{\ell_{tk}^2}
\biggr[
\frac{C_0}{\sigma_t} (1-e^{-\sigma_t \ell_{tk}})
+
\frac{C_1}{\sigma_t^2}
\biggr(
 1 - (1 + \sigma_t \ell_{tk} )
\biggr)e^{-\sigma_t \ell_{tk}}
\biggr]
\f]
with the code
\code
double w_exp  = (C0 / sigma_t) * (1.0 - exp(-sigma_t * ell_k)) +
                (C1 / (sigma_t * sigma_t)) *
                (1.0 - (1 + sigma_t * ell_k) * exp(-sigma_t * ell_k));
       w_exp *= weight / (ell_k * ell_k);
\endcode

Finally, the average weight is computed and the tally contribution is made
\code
double w_avg = w_harmonic * w_exp;

phi_tally[dof_map] += ell_k * w_avg ;
\endcode

At the end of each segment being processed we copy the shape function values
at \f$ s_{k+1} \f$ to \f$ s_k \f$, preventing us from having to compute the values
at \f$ s_k \f$ again (which can be expensive). We also apply the exponential
attenuation to the particle weight over the segment.
\code
shape_values_k = shape_values_kp1;
weight *= exp(-sigma_t * segment_length_k);
\endcode

\subsection CodeTut93Sec4_3 4.3 Approximating cell size
To obtain a very rough estimate of a cell's size we simply determine its
bounding box:
\code
auto GetCellApproximateSize = [&grid](const chi_mesh::Cell& cell)
{
  const auto& v0 = grid.vertices[cell.vertex_ids[0]];
  double xmin = v0.x, xmax = v0.x;
  double ymin = v0.y, ymax = v0.y;
  double zmin = v0.z, zmax = v0.z;

  for (uint64_t vid : cell.vertex_ids)
  {
    const auto& v = grid.vertices[vid];

    xmin = std::min(xmin, v.x); xmax = std::max(xmax, v.x);
    ymin = std::min(ymin, v.y); ymax = std::max(ymax, v.y);
    zmin = std::min(zmin, v.z); zmax = std::max(zmax, v.z);
  }

  return (chi_mesh::Vector3(xmin, ymin, zmin) -
          chi_mesh::Vector3(xmax, ymax, zmax)).Norm();
};
\endcode
The code here should be self explanatory.

\section CodeTut93Sec5 5 The raytracer
Instantiating a `chi_mesh::RayTracer` object is very simple. It just needs the
grid and the approximate cell sizes.
\code
std::vector<double> cell_sizes(grid.local_cells.size(), 0.0);
for (const auto& cell : grid.local_cells)
  cell_sizes[cell.local_id] = GetCellApproximateSize(cell);

chi_mesh::RayTracer ray_tracer(grid, cell_sizes);
\endcode

\section CodeTut93Sec6 6 Executing the algorithms
The basic process of simulating all the rays is fairly simple
\code
const size_t num_particles = 10'000'000;
for (size_t n=0; n<num_particles; ++n)
{
  if (n % size_t(num_particles/10.0) == 0)
    std::cout << "#particles = " << n << "\n";
  //====================================== Create the particle
  const auto omega = SampleRandomDirection();
  Particle particle{source_pos,     //position
                    omega,          //direction
                    0,              //e_group
                    1.0,            //weight
                    source_cell_id, //cell_id
                    true};          //alive

  while (particle.alive)
  {
    //=============================== Get the current cell
    const auto& cell = grid.cells[particle.cell_id];

    //=============================== Perform the trace
    //                                to the next surface
    auto destination_info = ray_tracer.TraceRay(cell,
                                                particle.position,
                                                particle.direction);

    const Vec3& end_of_track_position = destination_info.pos_f;

    //=============================== Make tally contribution
    const int g = particle.energy_group;
    if (sdm.type == PWLD)
      ContributePWLDTally(cell,
                          particle.position,     //positionA
                          end_of_track_position, //positionB
                          particle.direction,    //omega
                          g,                     //
                          particle.weight);      //weight at A

    //=============================== Process cell transfer
    //                                or death
    if (not destination_info.particle_lost)
    {
      const auto& f = destination_info.destination_face_index;
      const auto& current_cell_face = cell.faces[f];

      if (current_cell_face.has_neighbor)
        particle.cell_id = current_cell_face.neighbor_id;
      else
        particle.alive = false; //Death at the boundary
    }
    else
    {
      std::cout << "particle" << n << " lost "
                << particle.position.PrintStr() << " "
                << particle.direction.PrintStr() << " "
                << "\n";
      break;
    }

    const auto& pA = particle.position;
    const auto& pB = end_of_track_position;
    particle.weight *= exp(-sigma_t*(pB-pA).Norm()); //Attenuation
    particle.position = end_of_track_position;
  }//while ray alive

}//for ray n
\endcode

We start the process with the loop
\code
const size_t num_particles = 10'000'000;
for (size_t n=0; n<num_particles; ++n)
{
  if (n % size_t(num_particles/10.0) == 0)
    std::cout << "#particles = " << n << "\n";
\endcode
The information printing line simply prints at each 10% of completion.

We then create a source particle/ray
\code
const auto omega = SampleRandomDirection();
Particle particle{source_pos,     //position
                  omega,          //direction
                  0,              //e_group
                  1.0,            //weight
                  source_cell_id, //cell_id
                  true};          //alive
\endcode

Next we keep transporting the particle as long as it is alive. The beginning of
this loop is
\code
while (particle.alive)
{
  //=============================== Get the current cell
  const auto& cell = grid.cells[particle.cell_id];

  //=============================== Perform the trace
  //                                to the next surface
  auto destination_info = ray_tracer.TraceRay(cell,
                                              particle.position,
                                              particle.direction);

  const Vec3& end_of_track_position = destination_info.pos_f;
\endcode
After a trace we have one single track within a cell.

We then contribute the PWLD tally
\code
ContributePWLDTally(cell,
                    particle.position,     //positionA
                    end_of_track_position, //positionB
                    particle.direction,    //omega
                    particle.energy_group, //g
                    particle.weight);      //weight at A
\endcode

Next we process the transfer of the particle to the next cell. If the particle
hit a cell face without a neighbor then the particle is killed (i.e., `alive`
set to false. Under some circumstances the raytracer could also fail, resulting
in a lost particle, for which we print a verbose message.
\code
if (not destination_info.particle_lost)
{
  const auto& f = destination_info.destination_face_index;
  const auto& current_cell_face = cell.faces[f];

  if (current_cell_face.has_neighbor)
    particle.cell_id = current_cell_face.neighbor_id;
  else
    particle.alive = false; //Death at the boundary
}
else
{
  std::cout << "particle" << n << " lost "
            << particle.position.PrintStr() << " "
            << particle.direction.PrintStr() << " "
            << "\n";
  break;
}
\endcode

Lastly we update the particle's attenuation and position
\code
const auto& pA = particle.position;
const auto& pB = end_of_track_position;
particle.weight *= exp(-sigma_t*(pB-pA).Norm()); //Attenuation
particle.position = end_of_track_position;
\endcode



\section CodeTut93Sec7 7 Post-processing the tallies
The tallies up to this point are still in raw format. We need to convert them
to the project fashion we want.
\code
for (const auto& cell : grid.local_cells)
{
  //====================================== Compute mass matrix
  //                                       and its inverse
  const auto& cell_mapping = sdm.GetCellMapping(cell);
  const auto& qp_data = cell_mapping.MakeVolumeQuadraturePointData();
  const size_t num_nodes = cell_mapping.NumNodes();

  MatDbl M(num_nodes, VecDbl(num_nodes, 0.0));
  for (auto qp : qp_data.QuadraturePointIndices())
    for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
      for (size_t j=0; j<num_nodes; ++j)
        M[i][j] += qp_data.ShapeValue(i,qp) * qp_data.ShapeValue(j, qp) *
                   qp_data.JxW(qp);

  auto M_inv = chi_math::Inverse(M);

  //====================================== Apply projection
  VecDbl b(num_nodes, 0.0);
  for (size_t m=0; m<num_moments; ++m)
    for (size_t g=0; g<num_groups; ++g)
    {
      for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
      {
        const int64_t imap = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);
        b[i] = phi_tally[imap] / num_particles;
      }

      auto c = chi_math::MatMul(M_inv, b);

      for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
      {
        const int64_t imap = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);
        phi_tally[imap] = c[i];
      }
    }//for group g

}//for cell
\endcode

The first portion of the loop is simply housekeeping again
\code
for (const auto& cell : grid.local_cells)
{
  //====================================== Compute mass matrix
  //                                       and its inverse
  const auto& cell_mapping = sdm.GetCellMapping(cell);
  const auto& qp_data = cell_mapping.MakeVolumeQuadraturePointData();
  const size_t num_nodes = cell_mapping.NumNodes();

  MatDbl M(num_nodes, VecDbl(num_nodes, 0.0));
  for (auto qp : qp_data.QuadraturePointIndices())
    for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
      for (size_t j=0; j<num_nodes; ++j)
        M[i][j] += qp_data.ShapeValue(i,qp) * qp_data.ShapeValue(j, qp) *
                   qp_data.JxW(qp);

  auto M_inv = chi_math::Inverse(M);
\endcode
We get the cell mapping, quadrature point data, and we build the mass matrix.
Recall that we need \f$ \phi_j^{uc} \f$ such that
\f[
\sum_j \phi_j^{uc} \int_V b_i b_j dV = \int_V b_i \phi^{uc} dV,
\f]
which requires us to solve the small system
\f[
M \boldsymbol{\phi}^{uc} = \mathbf{T}
\f]
where \f$ M_{ij} = \int_V b_i b_j dV \f$ and
\f$ T_i = \int_V b_i \phi^{uc} dV \f$. Since the mass matrix is such a small
matrix we just directly invert it to be used for all groups and moments.

Next we loop over all moments and groups.
\code
VecDbl T(num_nodes, 0.0);
for (size_t m=0; m<num_moments; ++m)
  for (size_t g=0; g<num_groups; ++g)
  {
    for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
    {
      const int64_t imap = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);
      T[i] = phi_tally[imap] / num_particles;
    }

    auto phi_uc = chi_math::MatMul(M_inv, T);

    for (size_t i=0; i<num_nodes; ++i)
    {
      const int64_t imap = sdm.MapDOFLocal(cell, i, phi_uk_man, m, g);
      phi_tally[imap] = phi_uc[i];
    }
  }//for group g
\endcode

Within the moment and group loop we first set the entries of \f$ T \f$ to the
normalized tally values. Thereafter we multiply \f$ T \f$ from the left with
\f$ M^{-1} \f$ to get \f$ \boldsymbol{\phi}^{uc} \f$. Finally we reuse the tally
data and set the nodal values of the tally to the uncollided projected flux.

\section CodeTut93Sec8 8 Exporting field functions
Creating the field functions is similar to what we did in previous tutorials
\code
//============================================= Create Field Functions
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<chi_physics::FieldFunction>> ff_list;

ff_list.push_back(std::make_shared<chi_physics::FieldFunction>(
  "Phi",                                           //Text name

const size_t num_m0_dofs = sdm.GetNumLocalDOFs(m0_uk_man);

std::vector<double> m0_phi(num_m0_dofs, 0.0);

sdm.CopyVectorWithUnknownScope(phi_tally,     //from vector

                               0);          //to unknown-id

The visualization below shows a logarithmic scale warp of the flux values for
both the uncollided algorithm and a LBS simulation using a product quadrature
with 96 azimuthal angles and 48 polar angles per octant (18,432 directions total).

The left of the figure is the uncollided algorithm and the right is LBS. Notice
the stochastic "noise" from the uncollided algorithm.
